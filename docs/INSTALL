vThemes Plugin v1.5.1 Installation and Upgrading Instructions

vThemes follows the standard Geeklog plugins procedure.  Below we will document
2 methods to install the vThemes files, via FTP and via standard shell access
to the server.

FTP Installation

If you do not have shell access to your server and can only use an FTP client
to access your server, follow these instructions.

To install vThemes, or any Geeklog plugin, you will need to un-archive
the plugin on your local computer. The vThemes distribution will
automatically create all the proper directories when it is un-archived.

To un-archive a .gz file, you can use later copies of WinZIP, IZarc or WinRAR.

   1. Create a temporary directory on your local hard drive to hold the
      vThemes files (let's use C:\tmp for our example).
   2. Open the vthemes-1.5.1-1.5.1.tar.gz file with WinRAR.
   3. Select Extract All Files and point to the C:\tmp directory as the
      destination.

Now we should have a local copy of the vThemes Plugin in C:\tmp

The directory should look like this:

+tmp\
    + vthemes\
             + admin\
             + docs\
             + language\
             + public_html\
             + templates\
             + functions.inc
             +
			 
Now that you have a copy on your local hard drive, it is time to FTP up to
your server.

Start your FTP program, I recommend FileZilla if you do not have a program
you use already.  FileZilla is free and supports many different operating
systems (Windows, Linux, etc.).

Connect to your web server with your FTP program.

Our first FTP will be the entire vThemes distribution to your server.
You will want to use the diagrams below to find the proper directory on your
server and move the entire c:\tmp\vthemes\ directory to the
path-to-geeklog/plugins/ directory.

To find the path-to-geeklog you can look in your Geeklog config.php file and
see what directory is defined in the $_CONF[‘path’] line.

SPECIAL NOTE: For the initial FTP of the vThemes distribution, you will
want to actually drag the vthemes folder from your local computer to the
plugins directory on your server.  The remaining FTP’s below you will actually
drag the files, not the parent directory.

tmp\           path-to-geeklog/
   |                          |
   + vthemes\--+              + backups/
               |              + data/
               |              + include/
               |              + language/
               |              + logs/
               |              + pdfs/
               +------------->+ plugins/
                              + public_html/
                              + sql/
                              + system/
                              + config.php

Next, you will need to make a sub-directory under the public_html directory
on your server called vthemes. For most FTP programs you can create
directories by highlighting the parent directory, public_html in this case,
then right click the mouse, select New Folder and name it vthemes.
This procedure may be a little different depending on which FTP program you
are using, check their documentation.

  path-to-geeklog/
                 |
                 + backups/
                 + data/
                 + include/
                 + language/
                 + logs/
                 + pdfs/
                 + plugins/
                 + public_html/
                              |
                              + vthemes <--- Make this subdirectory
                 + sql/
                 + system/
                 + config.php

Next you will need to FTP all the files from the
c:\tmp\vthemes\public_html\* directory to your server.
Here you will want to select all the files and sub-directories in
the public_html\ directory, not just the public_html\ folder.
Follow the diagram below:

tmp\            path-to-geeklog/
   |                           |
   + vthemes\                  + backups/
            |                  + data/
            + public_html/*-+  + include/
                               |  + language/
                               |  + logs/
                               |  + pdfs/
                               |  + plugins/
                               |  + public_html/
                               |               |
                               +-------------->+ vthemes/
                                  + sql/
                                  + system/
                                  + config.php

Next, you will need to make a sub-directory under the admin/plugins/
directory on your server called vthemes.

path-to-geeklog/
               |
               + backups/
               + data/
               + include/
               + language/
               + logs/
               + pdfs/
               + plugins/
               + public_html/
               |       |
               |       + admin\
               |           |
               |           + plugins\
               |                    + vthemes <--- Make this subdirectory
               + sql/
               + system/
               + config.php

Next you will need to FTP all the files from the c:\tmp\vthemes\admin\*
directory to your server. Here you will want to select all the files and
sub-directories in the admin\ directory, not just the public_html\ folder.
Follow the map below:

tmp\       path-to-geeklog/
   |                      |
   + vthemes\             + backups/
            |             + data/
            + admin/---+  + include/
                       |  + language/
                       |  + logs/
                       |  + pdfs/
                       |  + plugins/
                       |  + public_html/
                       |               + admin/
                       |                      + plugins/
                       +---------------------------->  + vthemes/
                          + sql/
                          + system/
                          + config.php

Congratulations!  You should now have all the files uploaded to your server
and you are ready to skin to the Online Installation step below.

Standard Shell Access Installation

   1. Uncompress the vThemes plugin archive while in the
      path-to-geeklog/plugins directory. The archive will create a directory
      called vthemes.

   2. In your public_html directory, create a directory called vthemes.

   3. Under public_html/admin/plugins/ directory, create a directory
      called vthemes.

   4. Change to your path-to-geeklog/plugins/vthemes directory.

   5. Copy the files in the admin directory to the admin/plugins/vthemes
      directory you created in step 3.

   6. Copy the files in the public_html directory to the
      public_html/vthemes directory you created in step 3.

Online Installation

Now that you have the files loaded on your server, it is time to actually
perform the vThemes installation into Geeklog.

   1. Go to the plugin administration page. The vThemes plugin should
      show up with a link to install it. Click this link. The install page
      will tell you if it was successful or not. If not, examine the Geeklog
      error.log in path-to-geeklog/logs/ to see what the problem was. Fix the
      problem and re-install.

Standard Upgrade Process

   1. BACK UP YOUR EXISTING ENVIRONMENT!

   2. Refer to the installation instructions for New Installations for
      detailed instructions on uploading the new vThemes distribution to
      your server.

      If you are prompted to overwrite existing files, be sure to answer Yes.

   3. Go to the Geeklog Plugins Menu (from the Geeklog Administrator's menu).

   4. Select the vThemes plugin.

   5. You should have an UPDATE button, select it.

   6. If all goes well, the upgrade should be complete. If there were errors,
      please review your logs/error.log and correct any issues and try the
      UPDATE again.
