vThemes v1.6.0 Plugin README

vThemes is a Visual Theme Switcher and Browser for Geeklog v2.2.1 or higher.

For detailed installation and usage documentation, please refer to the /docs
directory.

For Theme Authors who want to support vThemes:

vThemes will look for the following file in the theme directory:
  - themefoldername.png or themefoldername.jpg - This is a screen shot 
	of the theme (usually 800 pixels wide or more)

All other information about the theme including name, version, description, 
author, etc is retrieved from the themes functions.php and theme_config_foo 
function. Take a look at the themes included with Geeklog for examples.
